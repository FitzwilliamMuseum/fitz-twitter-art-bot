# Fitzwilliam Museum Twitter Bot - random Art work

This twitter bot runs from a simple R script. This script
polls a random json endpoint from the collection database and
then assembles a tweet with:

* Link to record
* The image of the artwork
* The title of the artwork

This currently pulls just from the works in Prints and Drawings with a picture
attached, this may change.
